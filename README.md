Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  In this project, I was tasked with creating an item tracking software for a grocery store. 


What did you do particularly well?
  I believe that I did well with my coding. The software ran well and had very few errors. 



Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I believe that I can do better with in line comments. I believe my comments were vague sometimes, which is not up to par with the standards that are required in development.


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I struggled with creating a functional data backup file. I ended up creating a working one, however it needs improvement. 


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The overall knowledge of working with C++ will be very valuable. I am sure that i will use C++ more. 


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I added in line comments to the code to help organize the seperate functions.
